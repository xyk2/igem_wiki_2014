							<h1>Human Practice</h1>
							<p>Science is not complete without considering its ethical and social ramifications, as well as promoting it to the general public.</p>
							<p>What we discovered through our findings in human practice truly shaped the entirety of our project. Rather than focus on the unattainable goal of immortality, we realized that from multiple angles in our research that an even more desired and tangible goal was to use our project to increase healthy life span.</p>
							<p>We have organized human practice into three sections: Research, Outreach, and Entertainment. We first sought to collect opinions from experts in the field and all age groups in the public on the topics surrounding our project, as well as debate its ethics. Then, our next step was to bring synthetic biology and our project to the community. The last section deals with having a little bit of fun with our project and spreading the joy of iGEM.</p>

Whether it be sharing with other iGEM teams, surveys, interviews, or panel debates, we tried to reach out to a wide variety of people from all walks of life for a more complete picture.  </p>
